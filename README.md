## üß© Overview

This guide walks through how to mount a **TrueNAS NFS share** to a **Proxmox host**, bind it into an **unprivileged LXC container**, and then allow **Docker** within that container to use the share directly.  
The focus is on maintaining **consistent file ownership and permissions** (UID/GID = 1000) between TrueNAS, Proxmox, and Docker ‚Äî enabling seamless shared storage access without permission mismatches or root escalation issues.

---

## üóÑÔ∏è Step 1: Add the NFS Share to Proxmox

1. In the **Proxmox Web UI**, navigate to:  
   **Datacenter ‚Üí Storage ‚Üí Add ‚Üí NFS**

2. Fill out the required NFS details:
   - **ID:** A friendly name for your storage (e.g., `truenas-nfs`)
   - **Server:** The IP address or hostname of your TrueNAS server
   - **Export:** The exported NFS path (e.g., `/mnt/pool1/docker-share`)
   - **Content:** Select what the storage will be used for (e.g., `Disk image`, `Container`, `ISO image`, or `VZDump backup file`)
   - **Nodes:** Choose the Proxmox node(s) that should have access
   - **Options:** 
     - Check **Enable**
     - (Optional) Enable **Backup**, **ISO**, or **Container** depending on your use case

3. Click **Add** to finalize and mount the NFS share in Proxmox.

‚úÖ **Tip:** Verify the NFS share by going to **Datacenter ‚Üí Storage**, selecting your NFS entry, and checking the **Status** tab ‚Äî it should show **Active**.

---

## üìÅ Step 2: Create a Local Mount Point and Connect NFS via /etc/fstab

Once your NFS share is added to Proxmox, create a local directory where it will be mounted.  
This directory will act as the access point for the NFS share on the host.

```bash
mkdir -p /mnt/<mount-point>
```

Now, edit your `/etc/fstab` file to automatically mount the NFS share on boot:

```bash
nano /etc/fstab
```

Add the following line (replace placeholders with your own details):

```bash
<server-ip>:/mnt/<pool>/<dataset>   /mnt/<mount-point>   nfs4  rw,noatime,_netdev,x-systemd.automount,retry=5,timeo=14  0  0
```

### ‚öôÔ∏è Explanation

| Parameter | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| `<server-ip>:/mnt/<pool>/<dataset>` | The **server IP** and **exported path** of your TrueNAS NFS share |
| `/mnt/<mount-point>` | The **local mount point** on your Proxmox host |
| `nfs4` | Specifies the **NFS version** being used |
| `rw` | Mounts the share with **read/write** access |
| `noatime` | Prevents the system from updating file access timestamps ‚Äî improves performance |
| `_netdev` | Ensures the system waits for the **network to be available** before mounting |
| `x-systemd.automount` | Allows **on-demand mounting** instead of at boot, reducing boot delays |
| `retry=5` | Retries mounting up to **5 times** if the connection fails |
| `timeo=14` | Sets the **timeout** (in tenths of a second) for NFS requests |
| `0 0` | Disables **dump** and **fsck** for this mount (not needed for NFS) |

‚úÖ **Pro tip:** After saving `/etc/fstab`, test the mount immediately without rebooting:

```bash
mount -a
```

---

## üß© Step 3: Bind-Mount the Host NFS into the Unprivileged LXC

Use `pct set` to attach the host mount (created in Step 2) into your container.

```bash
# Replace placeholders:
# <ctid>           = your LXC container ID (e.g., 200)
# <host-mount>     = the host path where NFS is mounted (e.g., /mnt/media-nas)
# <container-path> = the path inside the container where you want it mounted (e.g., /mnt/nas)
pct set <ctid> --mp0 <host-mount>,mp=<container-path>
```

Reboot or restart the container to ensure the mount is active:

```bash
pct reboot <ctid>
# or
pct stop <ctid> && pct start <ctid>
```

---

## üîê Step 4: (Advanced) ID Mapping to Preserve UID/GID 1000 for Docker

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning:** Modifying user namespace mappings on unprivileged containers can weaken isolation if misconfigured. Proceed only if you understand the implications and have backups.

### 4.1 Allow the host to map UID/GID 1000

Edit these files **on the Proxmox host**:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/subuid
sudo nano /etc/subgid
```

Add or adjust entries:

```text
# /etc/subuid
# comment out what you originally had so you can go back and restore
root:100000:65536
root:1000:1
```
```text
# /etc/subgid
# comment out what you originally had so you can go back and restore
root:100000:65536
root:1000:1
```

### 4.2 Add custom ID maps to the container config

Edit `/etc/pve/lxc/<ctid>.conf`:

```text
lxc.idmap: u 0 100000 1000
lxc.idmap: u 1000 1000 1
lxc.idmap: u 1001 101001 64535

lxc.idmap: g 0 100000 1000
lxc.idmap: g 1000 1000 1
lxc.idmap: g 1001 101001 64535
```

Restart the container:

```bash
pct restart <ctid>
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Step 5: Pre-Create Docker Bind Mount Directories (Avoid Permission Conflicts)

Before running Docker containers that map volumes to your NFS share, **make sure the directories exist** on the mounted share.  
Docker tends to **create missing folders as root-mapped 100000**, not as user 1000, which can cause permission issues.

### üß© Why This Matters

If Docker creates a directory itself, it inherits shifted UID mappings, resulting in folders owned by `100000:100000` on the host.

### ‚úÖ The Fix

Create the full folder structure **manually** before starting Docker, and set ownership to user 1000.

```bash
mkdir -p /mnt/nas/configs/sonarr
mkdir -p /mnt/nas/media
chown -R 1000:1000 /mnt/nas/configs
chown -R 1000:1000 /mnt/nas/media
```

Example Docker Compose snippet:

```yaml
volumes:
  - /mnt/nas/configs/sonarr:/config
  - /mnt/nas/media:/media
```

As long as these directories exist and are owned by UID/GID 1000 **before** Docker initializes them,  
permissions will remain consistent across the NFS share.

---

### ‚úÖ Verification

Inside the container:

```bash
id
stat -c "%u:%g %n" <container-path>
touch <container-path>/testfile && ls -l <container-path>/testfile
```

On the host, confirm ownership appears as `1000:1000`.

> üí° If ownership doesn‚Äôt match, re-check `/etc/subuid`, `/etc/subgid`, and `lxc.idmap` for overlaps or typos.  
> Also ensure your NFS export isn‚Äôt applying `all_squash` or `root_squash`.
